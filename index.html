  TODOs/Caveats

  -No styleguide provided. So fonts, colors, sizes are approximate
  -Responsive design is pending
  -JS/HTML combined into one file for simplicity, this will be separated later
  -Page transitions haven't been coded since the use cases are unclear, only the home page has been coded
  -Simple state management has been demoed using the Home and More menu items
  -Split portions of the home page into separate components

  NOTES
  -Hex code picker http://htmlcolorcodes.com/
